				<h1>Our Vision</h1>
				<p>
					Somewhere, in a remote part of the world, stories are being shared in
					a village in the traditional way they always have; by the elders,
					sitting by the fire at night, duly passing along oral histories about
					their homelands that they learned from their ancestors, for the
					benefit of the younger community members sitting nearby. But something
					has changed. There are less youth around. Many have left the village
					to go work in nearby mining and logging concessions that are
					destroying the homelands. The few that remain are only passively
					listening, more engrossed in their phones. Without a proper listener,
					the words of the elders are ineffective, and they vanish in the air.
					Soon, the elders will pass along too, and with them their vast and
					ancient ancestral wisdom. One concerned community member, Maaike,
					decides to take action. Maaike has lived equal parts in the modern
					city and in the village, and is fluent in both worlds. She knows the
					power that digital media and the internet hold for preserving
					knowledge and for captivating the youth. She realizes that the words
					of the elders demonstrate the importance of caring for and protecting
					the community’s homelands, instead of permitting outsiders to destroy
					it. So, Maaike starts videorecording the elders to ensure that their
					stories live on for future generations. But she needs a way to show to
					the community, and to the outsiders, how the elders’ knowledge maps
					onto the homelands, which are being threatened. The traditional
					leadership is calling meetings in the village to discuss important
					matters about the future, but there is no internet there to stream
					videos or zoom in on digital maps. Back in the city, Maaike approaches
					a geographer, Maria, for help. In the past, Maria has worked with the
					community to make some maps showing their ancestral sites and local
					place names. Maria tells Maaike about a new application called
					Terrastories that can work entirely offline, and which she can use to
					manage the video recordings and pin them to points on the map. Maaike
					is intrigued, but apprehensive; while she knows how to use a computer
					to check email or Facebook, she has no technical background in the
					least. Maria assures her that she won’t need any of that, at all; in
					fact, while she herself has some knowledge of software used to make
					maps, she is not a technical person either, and it will be her first
					time using Terrastories too. They decide to do it together. Maria uses
					a platform called Mapbox Studio to lay out some of the community’s
					mapping data. Following the instructions, she downloads the
					Terrastories software onto Maaike’s laptop. She also downloads a map
					style file from Mapbox Studio, which she places in a designated area
					in the Terrastories files directory. From there, she double clicks the
					install file, which automatically sets up Terrastories on Maaike’s
					laptop with the map files that Maria customized in Mapbox Studio. Upon
					installation, they visit http://terrastories.io in the browser, and
					are welcomed by the Terrastories home screen. They click enter and see
					the mapping data laid out, ready for usage. From here, Maaike can take
					over. The instructions provide a startup login to enter the
					administrative back end. She logs in and new options appear on the
					interface to add and edit new stories. She attaches her external
					drive, and uses the user-friendly interface to upload videos and pin
					them to places on the map. Suddenly, the map is coming to life with
					the recordings of elders telling stories about the homelands. She can
					customize the interface with colors and visuals that are
					representative of her community. She is also able to set up a login
					for the community to access the most sacred of stories, which are for
					the community only and not supposed to be heard by the outsiders. But
					she leaves some of the stories as unrestricted too, so that these can
					be shared with the outsiders when needed. Maaike now has a tool on her
					laptop that she can share with her community, and she is elated. She
					shows it to community members of various ages who are able to use the
					application’s user-friendly interface to explore the map and the
					recordings of oral history storytelling. The application is translated
					into their own language, there are clear tutorial markers indicating
					how to use the application, and the interface is clean and attractive.
					The application provides tools to filter through the stories and the
					mapping content. The youth get it right away, but even the elders are
					able to use Terrastories with some initial guidance from Maaike. After
					all this, Maaike wishes there was a way to get it on the youth’s
					phones more directly, too. Maria reads through the Terrastories
					instructions and finds there is a way to install Terrastories on a
					device that can broadcast a wireless signal which other devices can
					connect to load the application. The instructions are thorough and
					complete, so she feels comfortable in obtaining the hardware and
					installing Terrastories onto that, as well. Now, Maaike can bring back
					the device to the school, turn it on, and it automatically transmits a
					wireless signal that the youth can connect to using their phones, and
					freely explore the map and story recordings on their own. Maaike feels
					satisfied having found a tool that can easily help her community
					preserve and visualize their place-based oral histories without much
					fuss or setup.
